The Three Gods Riddle is a classic logic puzzle that involves determining the identities of three gods based on their responses to questions. The riddle is known for its complexity and the need for careful logical reasoning to solve it. Here's a detailed explanation of the riddle:

The Riddle Statement
There are three gods named A, B, and C. Each god is one of the following:

True: Always tells the truth.

False: Always lies.

Random: Sometimes tells the truth and sometimes lies (answers randomly).

Your task is to determine which god is which by asking them questions. However, there are some constraints:

The gods answer in their own language, using the words "da" and "ja", which mean "yes" and "no" in some order, but you don't know which word means which.

You can only ask yes/no questions.

you can address your questions to specific gods (e.g., "God A, is B the Random god?").

The Random god's answers are unpredictable and could be either "da" or "ja" regardless of the question.
